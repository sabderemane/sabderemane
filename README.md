## Hi there 👩🏽‍💻👋

I'm a fullstack developer (she/her) from Paris, France. I'm working with Python and JavaScript language. I like to improve workflow and automate things, especially with GitHub Actions. I have a MS in Computer Science and I'm trying to contribute to Python ecosystem projects on my spare time.
